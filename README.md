Welcome to my GitHub Folks 🔥

I am a Data Scientist, currently working as a Consultant in various industries. 
Starting my career as a Geoscientist in the Oil and Gas industry I worked with exploring and modelling Big Data before it was a buzzword. I also worked as a Sr. Data Science Educator at BrainStation to help lifelong learners upskill and change careers! My work involved content development for DS courses, teaching and managing projects of our incredible students while undertaking several of my own. Some of them can be seen below:
- [Geological surface and subsurface mapping data](https://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/2014/30382chitransh/ndx_chitransh.pdf.html) 🏞️
- EUMETSAT Copernicus [Sentinel-6 satellite](https://www.eumetsat.int/sentinel-6) data 🛰️
- Twitter (now X) Topic Modelling (NLP)
- Anomaly Detection with Emissions Data from ClimateTrace
- Bank Transaction 🏦

I'm always looking for new projects to collaborate on in order to learn and grow 🌱. Currently working on a project involving Object Detection to understand the nuances of working with image data and Time Series modelling for Housing Data. If you're new to coding then you can also checkout the Advent repository where coding challenges are explained on a step by step basis. 

When not coding, I am usually reading or exploring local trails and restaurants, so always feel free to drop recommendations on any of those!
